synopsis:            Combinators for making point-free functions
description:         This combinators capture common patterns
    of argument's distribution over bodies in function's definitions.
    That makes easier to define functions with point-free bodies
    which are better suited for equational reasoning. Some definitions
    are taken from "Thinking functionally with Haskell" by Richard Bird.
